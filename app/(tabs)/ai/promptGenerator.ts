  1. Based on the following preferences, write a 3–4 line romantic travel date plan. Make it poetic, magical, and happy. Include emojis, but do NOT exceed 4 lines. Do NOT introduce it with anything like "Here's your plan", just start the plan directly.
  
  2. Then, in exactly 7 separate lines, write her "Vibe Summary" — soft, kind, personal, warm, and elegant. DO NOT write a paragraph. Each line must be meaningful and in one sentence only. Again, do NOT add any headings or intro text.
